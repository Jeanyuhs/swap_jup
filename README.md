Goal: Create a Solana snipe bot
Idea: Pair swap program with scrape program to grab new tokens and exit before rugpull. 
Status: stopped trying to accomplish with Jupiter since newest tokens not available right away. Received error "Token not found"
Solution: Find a way to create a program that works through Raydium directly since they handle most new coin liquidity pools.
